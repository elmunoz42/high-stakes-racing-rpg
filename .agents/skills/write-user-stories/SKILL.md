name: write-user-stories
description: Write or update user stories with testable acceptance criteria in agent-os/user-stories/, at demo (happy path) or production (edge cases) depth. Use when the user runs /write-user-stories, asks for user stories or acceptance criteria, or wants to backfill stories from existing code, specs, or a PRD.

# Write User Stories

Capture what users must be able to do as small, testable story files. Stories are long lived: they outlive specs and PRDs and are the contract that verify-stories checks in a browser and in tests.

## Important Guidelines

- **Ask with your structured question tool** (AskUserQuestion in Claude Code; the ask or question tool in Cursor and Codex). If none is available, ask in chat and wait.
- **Propose, don't interrogate.** Draft stories and acceptance criteria, then let the user confirm or edit.
- **Observable acceptance criteria only.** Every AC must be checkable by a person in the browser, or tagged `(unit)` when it is logic not visible in the UI.
- **Small stories.** One user goal per story, 1 to 5 ACs. Split anything larger.
- **Match the testing level.** Demo projects get happy path stories only. Production projects also get `(edge)` ACs and `[production]` stories. Levels are defined in `references/testing-levels.md`.
- Follow `references/story-format.md` exactly. Use `references/user-story-template.md` as the file skeleton.

## Inputs (pick from what the user gave)

1. **A feature description** in chat.
2. **A spec folder** in `agent-os/specs/` (plan.md, shape.md).
3. **A PRD**: prefer the prd-to-stories skill, which calls this format.
4. **Backfill** (`/write-user-stories backfill [area]`): read routes, pages, and existing tests to infer what users can already do. Also read old v2 specs (`agent-os/specs/*/spec.md`, `tasks.md`) if present.

If nothing was given, ask what to write stories for, offering these four options.

## Process

### Step 1: Load context

- Resolve the testing level as described in `references/testing-levels.md` (request, then `level:` in `agent-os/testing.yml`, otherwise ask once and save it). Say which level you are writing for.
- Read `agent-os/user-stories/index.yml` (create the folder and index from the template in `references/story-format.md` if missing).
- Read `agent-os/product/mission.md` if it exists, for roles and vocabulary.
- Note the highest existing ID. New IDs continue from it. Never renumber or reuse IDs.

### Step 2: Propose stories

Present a compact list, then confirm:

```
Proposed stories for team invites:

1. US-011 Invite a teammate by email
   AC1 Given I am an owner on /team, when I submit an email, then the invite appears as Pending
   AC2 Given an invite email, when the invitee opens the link, then signup shows their email prefilled
2. US-012 Revoke a pending invite
   AC1 Given a pending invite, when I click Revoke, then it disappears from the list
   AC2 (unit) A revoked invite token is rejected

Write these? (yes / edit 2: ... / drop 1 / add: ...)
```

At production level, also propose edge ACs from the checklist in `references/testing-levels.md`, tagged `(edge)`, and `[production]` stories for edge only goals. At demo level, propose none, and keep each story to the happy path the demo will show.

Check for duplicates against the index. If an existing story covers the same goal, propose an update to it instead of a new story.

### Step 3: Write files

For each confirmed story:

1. Write `agent-os/user-stories/US-###-short-slug.md` using the template.
2. Set `status: draft` unless the user said the behavior already exists and works (then `ready`).
3. Set `source:` to `manual`, `spec:<spec-folder>`, `prd-m<N>`, or `backfill`.
4. Set `verify:` to `[browser]`, `[unit]`, or `[browser, unit]` based on the AC tags.
5. Set `sets:` to `[demo, production]` when the story has any happy path AC, or `[production]` when every AC is `(edge)`.
6. Leave `tests:` empty. verify-stories fills it in.

### Step 4: Update the index

Add or update one entry per story in `agent-os/user-stories/index.yml`, sorted by ID:

```yaml
US-011:
  file: US-011-invite-teammate.md
  title: Invite a teammate by email
  status: draft
  tags: [team]
  sets: [demo, production]
  source: spec:2026-11-02-1430-team-invites
```

### Step 5: Link and hand off

- If working from a spec, add the IDs to the spec's `stories.md`.
- Tell the user which files were written and suggest: run verify-stories once the feature is built (or now, for backfilled stories).

## Status values

| status | meaning | who sets it |
|---|---|---|
| draft | written, behavior may not exist yet | write-user-stories |
| ready | behavior should exist, not yet verified | user or agent after building |
| verified | in-scope ACs passed in browser and are covered by committed tests; `verified_level` says demo or production | verify-stories only |
| failing | last verification failed | verify-stories only |
